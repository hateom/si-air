= Introduction =

SI-air is a university project for a Artifical Intelligence and Sensorics laboratory.
The aim of the project is to improve computer control using *video camera*, and your *hand*.
The program can detect your hand and its position, and react with specific gestures. 
Prearranged gestures are used to simulate windows actions like:
  * mouse clicks
  * moving mouse cursor

= Details =

Project is splitted into *modular parts*. The modular design allows designers to implement various kinds of plugins and extensions, and extend functionality in almost *any direction*.

The main modules included:
  * video acquisition module 
  * probability image generator module
  * position and gesture detection module (based on camshift algorithm)
  * system calls generator
